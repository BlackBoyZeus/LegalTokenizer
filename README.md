# LegalTokenizer

Let's say we have a legal contract that includes the following text:

"Section 3.3(c) of this Agreement shall be amended to read as follows: 'The Company shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.'"

Here's an example of how a domain-specific tokenizer for legal contracts might tokenize this text:

Section 3.3(c) would be identified as a section heading.
"Agreement" would be identified as a legal-specific term.
"shall be amended" would be identified as a legal-specific phrase.
"to read as follows:" would be identified as a legal-specific phrase.
The text within the quotation marks would be identified as a legal-specific clause.
"Confidential Information" and "Disclosing Party" would be identified as legal-specific terms.
"third party" would be identified as a legal-specific term.
Overall, this hypothetical tokenizer would be designed to accurately identify legal-specific language patterns, formatting conventions, and terms in order to accurately tokenize legal contracts.
